# Bootcamp prework study guide for students

## Description

To visit website, please go to [(https://goldengayle.github.io/prework-study-guide/prework-study-guide.)] 
This study guide was an introduction to creating a website. As I am about to learn coding in Bootcamp, this was an opportunity to independently explore the process and take notes along the way. 

This study guide is adapatable as I learn new skills, and forms a repository of my learning, which is currently very limited to an introduction of HTML, CSS, Javscript, and Git.

## Installation

## Usage

This website contains unique sections that have notes about each of 4 topics, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and GIT. By opening the DevTools console, the user can see the JavaScript file run- listing the four topics and suggesting a random one for the user to study.
